 Here is a summary of the conversation:

- The student watched a video of a man balancing while juggling to capture data on his movements. 

- The instructor notes that balancing and juggling are complex perceptuomotor tasks that involve coordinating the body and adapting to the environment. The instructor asks how this relates to the student's interests in understanding neural control of human movement.

- The student says the software used to collect the data can also be used to collect data on people playing sports. The instructor agrees this can help understand neural control of complex, dynamic movements.

- The student says they are interested in field hockey and lacrosse. The instructor suggests searching for research on neural control of movements in those sports, using terms like "neural control of field hockey" or "neural control of lacrosse".

- The instructor cannot directly search online databases but provides suggested search terms and strategies to find relevant literature. The terms include:

1. "neural control of field hockey"  
2. "neural control of lacrosse"
3. "motor learning in field hockey" 
4. "motor learning in lacrosse"
5. "movement coordination in field hockey"
6. "movement coordination in lacrosse"

- The instructor explains that "perceptuomotor" refers to perception (sensory information) and motor control (coordinating muscles for movement). In the course context, perceptuomotor tasks involve understanding how the brain processes sensory information and generates appropriate motor responses for complex actions like juggling or sports.
