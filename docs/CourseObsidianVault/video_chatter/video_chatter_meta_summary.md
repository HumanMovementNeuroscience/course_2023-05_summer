# Video Description: 
The video shows a person juggling while balancing on a moving board, demonstrating complex perceptuomotor skills and neural mechanisms involved in multitasking, spatial awareness, and body coordination. Their movements and ball locations are visualized using 3D graphs generated by motion capture technology, specifically FreeMoCap.

# The main task
- Investigate the neural control of real-world human movement in the context of juggling and balancing
- Analyze the data to identify patterns related to expertise, motor control, sensory integration, and motor adjustments
- Understand the interaction between brain regions like the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex during these tasks
- Investigate how the nervous system allows for multitasking and balance during complex tasks
- Compare novices and experts to understand motor learning and expertise development

# Subtasks (list up to 5-8 subtasks)
- Capture data from the video using Freemocap
  - Computer Vision and Machine Learning (tracking and recording human movement)
- Examine the differences in hand heights and ball trajectories
  - Motor control (understanding how handedness, juggling technique, or balancing aspect affects the task)
- Compare advanced and intermediate jugglers
  - Motor skill learning (investigating how expertise develops and affects movement)
- Explore motor cortex plasticity and its role in learning dexterous skills
  - Neuroscience (studying the neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in skill acquisition and refinement)
- Understand the role of the visual system in spatial awareness
  - Neuroscience (processing visual information for spatial awareness)
- Examine the motor cortex's involvement in body coordination
  - Neuroscience (controlling voluntary muscle movements)
- Study the cerebellum's role in balance and coordination
  - Neuroscience (regulating motor movements and maintaining balance)
- Investigate the vestibular system's contribution to balance
  - Neuroscience (providing information about head position and movement)
