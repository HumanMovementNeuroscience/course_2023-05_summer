 Here is a refined summary based on the additional context:

- The original prompt describes a video showing 3D motion capture of a human balancing while juggling. This complex perceptuomotor task requires coordination and control of multiple body parts. Analyzing this video could provide insights into neural mechanisms behind movement control, sensory integration, and motor adjustments.

- Comparing novices and experts could shed light on motor learning and expertise development. The response requests and is provided research articles on these topics.

- Five research articles are provided on the requested topics:

1. Motor learning characterized by changing attractor landscapes. Explores how motor skills are acquired and adapted. 

2. Developing children: Their changing movement. Discusses motor development and learning in children.

3. The coordination of movement in three-dimensional space. Analyzes kinematics and kinetics of complex movements.

4. Information feedback for motor skill learning: a review. Reviews role of feedback in motor learning.

5. Meta-analytical definition and functional connectivity of the human vestibular cortex. Defines brain areas involved in balance and spatial orientation.

- Additional research articles are provided on sensory integration, motor learning, and expertise in balancing and juggling. The video seems like a valuable resource to study these topics and gain insights into neural control of movement, sensory feedback, and motor adjustments.

- The summary concludes that these articles provide a good starting point for researching perceptuomotor skills like those involved in balancing and juggling. The video and additional resources offer an opportunity to explore motor learning and expertise development. Further help is offered if needed.
