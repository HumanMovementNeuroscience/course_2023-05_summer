# Video Description: 
The video shows a person juggling while balancing on a moving board, with their movements and ball locations visualized using 3D graphs.

# The main task
 - Investigate the neural control of real-world human movement in the context of juggling
 - Analyze the data to identify patterns related to expertise and motor control

# Subtasks (list up to 5-8 subtasks)
 - Examine the differences in hand heights and ball trajectories
    - Motor control (understanding how handedness, juggling technique, or balancing aspect affects the task)
 - Compare advanced and intermediate jugglers
    - Motor skill learning (investigating how expertise develops and affects movement)
 - Explore motor cortex plasticity and its role in learning dexterous skills
    - Neuroscience (studying the neural mechanisms and circuitry involved in skill acquisition and refinement)

# What kind of data is represented in the video?
- 3D graphs of human movements and ball locations during juggling
