# Abstract:

Sure! ðŸ˜Š The study examines the link between basic cognitive functions and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players. They found positive relationships between cognitive abilities, like attention window and working memory capacity, and skills such as dribbling, ball control, and juggling. The results suggest that both physical and psychological skills are interconnected and essential for soccer performance, highlighting the need for more research on cognition-motor skill relationships.  

# Summary/Overview:

- Examined link between cognition and motor skills in elite youth soccer players 
- Found positive relationships between cognitive abilities (e.g. attention, working memory) and soccer skills (e.g. dribbling, ball control)
- Physical and psychological skills are interconnected and important for performance
- Highlights need to study cognition-motor skill relationships further
