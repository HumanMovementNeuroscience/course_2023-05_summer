# Abstract:
We present a study that explores the use of a commercially available eye tracker as a control device for video games. We examine its use across multiple gaming genres and present games that utilize the eye tracker in a variety of ways. First, we describe a first-person shooter that uses the eyes to control orientation. Second, we study the use of eye movements for more natural interaction with characters in a role playing game. And lastly, we examine the use of eye tracking as a means to control a modified version of the classic action/arcade game Missile Command. Our results indicate that the use of an eye tracker can increase the immersion of a video game and can significantly alter the gameplay experience.
