## Abstract

This study investigated the influence of visual cues and perceptual style on static and dynamic balance performance. Twenty-five field dependent (FD) and twenty-five field independent (FI) participants performed tests of static and dynamic balance under five different vision conditions. Balance performance was measured using the Biodex Balance System. The vision conditions included: eyes open with visual feedback (EOFB), without visual feedback (EOEC), viewing lines tilted 18 degrees (EOTL), eyes open without any visual cues (EONC), and eyes closed (EC). All participants were more stable when visual cues were present. Results revealed no significant difference between the two groups on the static balance task in any of the vision conditions. A significant difference was found between the two groups on the dynamic balance task. In three of the vision conditions (EOFB, EOEC, EOTL), the FI group was found to be more stable than the FD group. Movement of the body required during a dynamic balance task generates vestibular and somatosensory information which FI individuals translate more efficiently for greater stability in dynamic balance tasks.


## Basic Methodology

Twenty-five field dependent (FD) and twenty-five field independent (FI) participants performed tests of static and dynamic balance under five different vision conditions. Balance performance was measured using the Biodex Balance System.


## Detailed Summary

* Investigated the influence of visual cues and perceptual style on static and dynamic balance performance
* Performed static and dynamic balance tests under five vision conditions
* Participants more stable with visual cues present
* No significant difference between FD and FI groups in static balance tasks
* Significant difference between FD and FI groups in dynamic balance tasks, with FI group more stable in three vision conditions
* Study suggests FI individuals translate vestibular and somatosensory information more efficiently for greater stability in dynamic balance tasks


## Short Summary

This study investigated the influence of visual cues and perceptual style on static and dynamic balance performance. Results revealed no significant difference between the two groups on the static balance task in any of the vision conditions, but a significant difference was found between the two groups on the dynamic balance task.


## Very Short Summary

This study investigated the influence of visual cues and perceptual style on static and dynamic balance performance.
