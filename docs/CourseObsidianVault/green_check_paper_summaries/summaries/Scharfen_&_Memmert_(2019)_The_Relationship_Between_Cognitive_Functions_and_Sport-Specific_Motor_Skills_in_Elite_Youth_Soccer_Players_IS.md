## Abstract

The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between basic cognitive functions and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players. A total of 15 elite youth soccer players aged 11-13 years performed a computer-based test battery measuring the attention window (AW), perceptual load (PL), working memory capacity (WMC), and multiple object tracking (MOT). Another set of tests was used to asses speed abilities and football-specific technical skills (sprint, change of direction, dribbling, ball control, shooting, and juggling). Spearman's correlation tests showed that the diagonal AW was positively associated with dribbling skills (rs = 0.656) which indicates that a broader AW could be beneficial for highly demanding motor skills like dribbling. WMC was positively related to dribbling (rs = 0.562), ball control (rs = 0.669), and ball juggling (rs = 0.727). Additionally, the cumulated score of all cognitive tests was positively related to the cumulated motor test score (rs = 0.614) which supports the interplay of physical and psychological skills. Our findings highlight the need for more, and especially longitudinal, studies to enhance the knowledge of cognition-motor skill relationships for talent identification, talent development, and performance in soccer.


## Basic Methodology

A total of 15 elite youth soccer players aged 11-13 years performed a computer-based test battery measuring the attention window (AW), perceptual load (PL), working memory capacity (WMC), and multiple object tracking (MOT). Another set of tests was used to asses speed abilities and football-specific technical skills (sprint, change of direction, dribbling, ball control, shooting, and juggling).


## Detailed Summary

This study examined the relationship between basic cognitive functions and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players. * Spearman's correlation tests showed that the diagonal Attention Window (AW) was positively associated with dribbling skills. * Working Memory Capacity (WMC) was positively related to dribbling, ball control, and ball juggling. * The cumulated score of all cognitive tests was positively related to the cumulated motor test score, indicating an interplay of physical and psychological skills. * The findings suggest that more research is needed to enhance the knowledge of cognition-motor skill relationships for soccer performance.


## Short Summary

This study examined the relationship between basic cognitive functions and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players, finding positive relationships between cognitive abilities and skills such as dribbling, ball control, and juggling. The results suggest that both physical and psychological skills are interconnected and essential for soccer performance.


## Very Short Summary

This study found positive relationships between cognitive abilities and sport-specific motor skills in elite youth soccer players.
