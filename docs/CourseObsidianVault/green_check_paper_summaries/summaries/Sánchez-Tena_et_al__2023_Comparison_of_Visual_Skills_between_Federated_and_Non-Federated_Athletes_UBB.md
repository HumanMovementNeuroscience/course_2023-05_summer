## Abstract

To perform motor tasks, athletes must gather a considerable amount of visual information quickly. Evidence shows that visual skills vary between athletes and non-athletes, and impact athletic performance. However, there is no scientific evidence suggesting that there are any differences between the visual skills of federated and non-federated athletes. As such, the objective of this paper was to compare how visual skills influence the sports performance of federated and non-federated athletes, respectively. Methods: A visual examination has been conducted on a total of 52 athletes between 18 and 37 years of age. The COI-Sport Vision system screen (International Optometry Center, Madrid, Spain) was used to examine static visual acuity, dynamic visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis, fixation disparity, visual memory, identification, anticipation time, peripheral awareness, and hand-eye coordination. Results: On average, federated athletes train more hours per day than non-federated athletes (1.4 ± 0.8) (p = 0.046). A significant correlation was observed between the average time of visual memory (β = −0.0683, p < 0.001), the average time of anticipation (β = 0.006, p = 0.009), the average time of peripheral awareness (β = 0.026, p = 0.002), hand-eye coordination (β = 0.028, p = 0.004), dynamic visual acuity (β = 0.055, p < 0.001), and the number of training hours. Conclusion: Results suggest that federated athletes are more concerned about their ocular health. Nonetheless, no differences were found in the oculomotor skills of both groups. Further investigation is required to consider each sport discipline individually.


## Basic Methodology

A visual examination was conducted on a total of 52 athletes between 18 and 37 years of age using the COI-Sport Vision system screen, testing various visual skills.


## Detailed Summary

* Objective: Compare visual skills' influence on sports performance between federated and non-federated athletes
* Participants: 52 athletes, aged 18-37
* Method: Visual examination using the COI-Sport Vision system screen, testing various visual skills
* Key finding: Federated athletes train more hours per day than non-federated athletes (1.4 ± 0.8, p = 0.046)
* Results: Significant correlations observed between training hours and visual memory, anticipation time, peripheral awareness, hand-eye coordination, and dynamic visual acuity
* Conclusion: Federated athletes are more concerned about ocular health, but no differences found in oculomotor skills between groups. More research needed considering individual sport disciplines.


## Short Summary

This paper compared the visual skills of federated and non-federated athletes and found that federated athletes train more hours per day than non-federated athletes. Significant correlations were observed between training hours and visual memory, anticipation time, peripheral awareness, hand-eye coordination, and dynamic visual acuity. No differences were found in oculomotor skills between groups.


## Very Short Summary

This paper compared the visual skills of federated and non-federated athletes and found that federated athletes train more hours per day than non-federated athletes.


## Extremely Short Summary
