## Abstract

Proprioceptive information from the foot/ankle provides important information regarding body sway for balance control, especially in situations where visual information is degraded or absent. Given known increases in catastrophic injury due to falls with older age, understanding the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control is particularly important for older adults. In the present study, we linked neural activity in response to stimulation of key foot proprioceptors (i.e., muscle spindles) with balance ability across the lifespan. Twenty young and 20 older human adults underwent proprioceptive mapping; foot tendon vibration was compared with vibration of a nearby bone in an fMRI environment to determine regions of the brain that were active in response to muscle spindle stimulation. Several body sway metrics were also calculated for the same participants on an eyes-closed balance task. Based on regression analyses, multiple clusters of voxels were identified showing a significant relationship between muscle spindle stimulation-induced neural activity and maximum center of pressure excursion in the anteriorâ€“posterior direction. In this case, increased activation was associated with greater balance performance in parietal, frontal, and insular cortical areas, as well as structures within the basal ganglia. These correlated regions were age- and foot-stimulation side-independent and largely localized to right-sided areas of the brain thought to be involved in monitoring stimulus-driven shifts of attention. These findings support the notion that, beyond fundamental peripheral reflex mechanisms, central processing of proprioceptive signals from the foot is critical for balance control.


## Basic Methodology

The study involved 20 young and 20 older adults undergoing proprioceptive mapping through foot tendon vibration and fMRI, and performing an eyes-closed balance task. Several body sway metrics were also calculated.


## Detailed Summary

* Proprioceptive information from foot/ankle is essential for balance control, especially when visual information is limited or absent.
* Understanding the neural basis of proprioceptive processing is important for older adults, as falls and injuries increase with age.
* The study involved 20 young and 20 older adults undergoing proprioceptive mapping through foot tendon vibration and fMRI.
* Participants also performed an eyes-closed balance task, and several body sway metrics were calculated.
* Multiple brain regions showed a significant relationship between muscle spindle stimulation-induced activity and maximum center of pressure excursion in the anterior-posterior direction.
* Increased activation was linked to better balance performance in parietal, frontal, and insular cortical areas, as well as structures within the basal ganglia.
* Correlated regions were age- and foot-stimulation side-independent, and largely localized to right-sided brain areas involved in monitoring stimulus-driven shifts of attention.
* The findings support the idea that central processing of proprioceptive signals from the foot is crucial for balance control, in addition to peripheral reflex mechanisms.


## Short Summary

This study investigated the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control in young and older adults. Results showed that increased activation in certain brain regions was linked to better balance performance, and that these regions were largely localized to right-sided areas of the brain involved in monitoring stimulus-driven shifts of attention.


## Very Short Summary

This study investigated the neural basis of proprioceptive processing for balance control in young and older adults, and found that increased activation in certain brain regions was linked to better balance performance.
