## Abstract

This paper aims to develop understanding of three important motor control issues--feedforward mechanisms, cortical plasticity and task-specificity and assess the implications for musculoskeletal practice. A model of control for the reach-to-grasp movement illustrates how the central nervous system integrates sensorimotor processes to control complex movements. Feedforward mechanisms, an essential element of motor control, are altered in neurologically intact patients with chronic neck pain and low back pain. In healthy subjects, cortical mapping studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated that neural pathways adapt according to what and how much is practised. Neuroplasticity has also been demonstrated in a number of musculoskeletal conditions, where cortical maps are altered compared to normal. Behavioural and neurophysiological studies indicate that environmental and task constraints such as the goal of the task and an object's shape and size, are determinants of the motor schema for reaching and other movements. Consideration of motor control issues as well as signs and symptoms, may facilitate management of musculoskeletal conditions and improve outcome. Practice of entire everyday tasks at an early stage and systematic variation of the task is recommended. Training should be directed with the aim of re-educating feedforward mechanisms where necessary and the amount of practice should be sufficient to cause changes in cortical activity.


## Basic Methodology

Cortical mapping studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation and behavioural and neurophysiological studies were used to assess motor control issues and their implications for musculoskeletal practice.


## Detailed Summary

* The paper focuses on three motor control issues: feedforward mechanisms, cortical plasticity, and task-specificity.
* A model of control for reach-to-grasp movement is used to illustrate how the central nervous system integrates sensorimotor processes for complex movements.
* Feedforward mechanisms are crucial for motor control but are altered in patients with chronic neck and low back pain who have no neurological issues.
* Cortical mapping studies show that neural pathways adapt based on the type and amount of practice in healthy subjects.
* Neuroplasticity has been observed in various musculoskeletal conditions, with altered cortical maps compared to normal individuals.
* Environmental and task constraints, such as the goal of the task and an object's shape and size, influence the motor schema for reaching and other movements.
* Considering motor control issues alongside signs and symptoms may help manage musculoskeletal conditions and improve outcomes.
* Early practice of entire everyday tasks and systematic variation of the task is recommended.
* Training should aim to re-educate feedforward mechanisms where needed and include sufficient practice to cause changes in cortical activity.
