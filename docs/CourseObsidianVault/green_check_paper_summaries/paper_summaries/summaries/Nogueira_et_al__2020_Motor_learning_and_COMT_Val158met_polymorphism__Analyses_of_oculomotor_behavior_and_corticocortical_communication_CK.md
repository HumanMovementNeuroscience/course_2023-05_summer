## Abstract

Differences in motor learning can be partially explained by differences in genotype. The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism regulates the dopamine (DA) availability in the prefrontal cortex modulating motor learning and performance. Given the differences in tonic and phasic DA transmission, this study aimed to investigate whether the greater cognitive flexibility associated with the Val allele would favor the learning of movement parametrization, while the greater cognitive stability associated with the Met allele favors the acquisition of the movement pattern. Furthermore, we investigated if the genotypic characteristics impact visual scanning of information related to parametrization and to the movement pattern, and the level of cortical connectivity associated with motor planning and control. Performance and learning of a sequential motor task were compared among three genotypes (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met), as well as their oculomotor behavior and level of cortical coherence. The findings show that the cognitive flexibility promoted by the Val allele is associated with a better parametrization. The search for information through visual scanning was specific to each genotype. Also, a greater cortical connectivity associated with the Val allele was found. The combined study of behavioral, electrophysiological and molecular levels of analysis showed that the cognitive stability and flexibility associated with the COMT alleles, influence specific aspects of motor learning.


## Basic Methodology

The study compared performance, oculomotor behavior, and cortical coherence across three genotypes (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met) in a sequential motor task.


## Detailed Summary

* This paper investigates the influence of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, which affects dopamine (DA) availability in the prefrontal cortex, on motor learning and performance. 
* The authors explore whether the cognitive flexibility of the Val allele promotes learning of movement parametrization, while the cognitive stability of the Met allele favors the acquisition of the movement pattern. 
* The study compares performance, oculomotor behavior, and cortical coherence across three genotypes (Val/Val, Val/Met, and Met/Met) in a sequential motor task. 
* Results show that the Val allele's cognitive flexibility is associated with better parametrization, genotype-specific visual scanning, and greater cortical connectivity.
