## Abstract

Accumulating neuropsychological, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence suggests that the neural substrates of visual perception may be quite distinct from those underlying the visual control of actions. In other words, the set of object descriptions that permit identification and recognition may be computed independently of the set of descriptions that allow an observer to shape the hand appropriately to pick up an object. We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.



## Basic Methodology

 This is a literature review



## Detailed Summary
-The paper explores the idea that the neural substrates for visual perception and the visual control of actions are separate.
-The authors propose that the ventral stream (from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex) is primarily involved in the perceptual identification of objects.
-The dorsal stream (from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region) is posited to mediate sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at objects.




## Short Summary
Goodale and Milner's 1992 paper posits that visual perception and visual control of actions rely on separate neural pathways. They propose that the ventral stream, running from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex, is responsible for object identification, while the dorsal stream, leading from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region, enables sensorimotor transformations needed for visually guided actions.



## Very Short Summary

Goodale and Milner suggest two distinct visual pathways: the ventral stream for object identification and the dorsal stream for visually guided actions.


## Extremely Short Summary

The paper proposes separate visual pathways for perception and action.
