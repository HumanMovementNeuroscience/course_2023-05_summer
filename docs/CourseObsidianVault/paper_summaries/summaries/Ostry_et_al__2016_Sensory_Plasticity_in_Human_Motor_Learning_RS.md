## Abstract

There is accumulating evidence from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies that the acquisition of motor skills involves both perceptual and motor learning. Perceptual learning alters movements, motor learning, and motor networks of the brain. Motor learning changes perceptual function and the sensory circuits of the brain. Here, we review studies of both human limb movement and speech that indicate that plasticity in sensory and motor systems is reciprocally linked. Taken together, this points to an approach to motor learning in which perceptual learning and sensory plasticity have a fundamental role.

## Detailed Summary

* Ostry & Gribble's paper, "Sensory Plasticity in Human Motor Learning," emphasizes the importance of sensory plasticity and perceptual learning in motor learning. 
    * The authors showcase the interconnectedness between perceptual learning, which improves our senses' ability to process sensory information, and motor learning, which focuses on enhancing motor control and performance. 
    * By examining studies on human limb movement and speech, they demonstrate that sensory and motor system changes are reciprocally linked. 
    * The paper ultimately advocates for a well-rounded approach to motor learning, highlighting the significance of sensory plasticity and perceptual learning.
