## Abstract

The cerebellar cortex is a crystal-like structure consisting of an almost endless repetition of a canonical microcircuit that applies the same computational principle to different inputs. The output of this transformation is broadcasted to extracerebellar structures by way of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Visually guided eye movements are accommodated by different parts of the cerebellum. This review primarily discusses the role of the oculomotor part of the vermal cerebellum [the oculomotor vermis (OMV)] in the control of visually guided saccades and smooth-pursuit eye movements. Both types of eye movements require the mapping of retinal information onto motor vectors, a transformation that is optimized by the OMV, considering information on past performance. Unlike the role of the OMV in the guidance of eye movements, the contribution of the adjoining vermal cortex to visual motion perception is nonmotor and involves a cerebellar influence on information processing in the cerebral cortex.


## Basic Methodology

The review discusses the role of the oculomotor part of the vermal cerebellum in the control of visually guided saccades and smooth-pursuit eye movements. It considers information on past performance and involves a cerebellar influence on information processing in the cerebral cortex.


## Detailed Summary

* The cerebellum is a unique region of the brain that receives input through the cerebellar cortex and processes these various and often diverse sensory inputs on a local level to signal kinematic response. This list of inputs includes the computation required for at least two types of visual eye movement, those being smooth pursuit eye-movement (SPEM) involved in tracking mobile objects and saccadic eye movement involved in tracking across stationary objects.
* Specific key regions in the cerebellar cortex include the flocculus and the hemispheric oculomotor region (HOR), with the neighboring oculomotor vermis (OMV) also being of great importance. All three of these parts contribute in some way to the stabilization and visual guiding of eye movement for tracking purposes.
* The OMV includes cells, called Purkinje Cells (PC), that contribute both to ocular kinematic activity based on not only current input, but also past and predicted future input in the instance of computational error, to properly shift and balance the eyes.
* The cerebellar cortex focuses more on computing the visual consequences that would arise from motion in the observed environment.


## Short Summary

This review discusses the role of the oculomotor part of the vermal cerebellum in the control of visually guided saccades and smooth-pursuit eye movements. The OMV includes cells, called Purkinje Cells (PC), that contribute both to ocular kinematic activity based on not only current input, but also past and predicted future input. The cerebellar cortex focuses more on computing the visual consequences that would arise from motion in the observed environment.


## Very Short Summary
