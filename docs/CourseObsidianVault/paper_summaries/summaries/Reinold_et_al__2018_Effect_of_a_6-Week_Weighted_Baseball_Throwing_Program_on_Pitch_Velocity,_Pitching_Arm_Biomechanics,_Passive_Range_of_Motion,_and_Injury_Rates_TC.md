## Abstract

Background: Emphasis on enhancing baseball pitch velocity has become popular, especially through weighted-ball throwing. However, little is known about the physical effects or safety of these programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of training with weighted baseballs on pitch velocity, passive range of motion (PROM), muscle strength, elbow torque, and injury rates. Methods: During the baseball offseason, 38 healthy baseball pitchers were randomized into a control group and an experimental group. Pitch velocity, shoulder and elbow PROM, shoulder strength, elbow varus torque, and shoulder internal rotation velocity were measured in both groups. The experimental group then performed a 6-week weighted ball throwing program 3 times per week using balls ranging from 2 to 32 ounces while the control group only used a 5-ounce regulation baseball. Both groups performed a strength training program. Measurements were then repeated after the 6-week period. Injuries were tracked over the 6-week training program and the subsequent baseball season. The effect of training with a weighted ball program was assessed using 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance at an a priori significance level of P < 0.05. Results: Mean age, height, mass, and pretesting throwing velocity were 15.3 ± 1.2 years (range, 13-18 years), 1.73 ± 0.28 m, 68.3 ± 11 kg, and 30.3 ± 0.7 m/s, respectively. Pitch velocity showed a statistically significant increase (3.3%) in the experimental group ( P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant increase of 4.3° of shoulder external rotation in the experimental group. The overall injury rate was 24% in the experimental group. Four participants in the experimental group suffered elbow injuries, 2 during the training program and 2 in the season after training. No pitchers in the control group were injured at any time during the study. Conclusion: Performing a 6-week weighted ball throwing program increased pitch velocity.


## Basic Methodology

38 healthy baseball pitchers were randomized into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group then performed a 6-week weighted ball throwing program 3 times per week using balls ranging from 2 to 32 ounces while the control group only used a 5-ounce regulation baseball. Both groups performed a strength training program. Measurements were then repeated after the 6-week period. Injuries were tracked over the 6-week training program and the subsequent baseball season.


## Detailed Summary

* This study is about the effects of a 6-week weighted ball throwing program on pitch velocity, shoulder external rotation, and injury rate in young baseball pitchers. 
* The results showed a significant increase in pitch velocity (3.3%) and shoulder external rotation (4.3°) in the experimental group. 
* However, there was also an increased injury rate of 24% in the experimental group, with four participants experiencing elbow injuries. 
* We see this program affect the pitcher's biomechanics, as the evidence is in the increased pitch velocity and consequential increase in external shoulder rotation. 
* This study suggests changes to the pattern of the shoulder and elbow, as seen in the elbow injuries and shoulder rotation, relating this to the musculoskeletal system. 
* The motor cortex is adapting to support this faster pitch speed, and refining the movement patterns to do so. 
* Finally, we see neuroscience involved as the body trying to adapt to stress or damage, as we see again in the elbow injuries and external rotation of the shoulder.


## Short Summary

This study examined the effects of a 6-week weighted ball throwing program on pitch velocity, shoulder external rotation, and injury rate in young baseball pitchers. The results showed a significant increase in pitch velocity (3.3%) and shoulder external rotation (4.3°) in the experimental group, but also an increased injury rate of 24% with four participants experiencing elbow injuries.


## Very Short Summary
